<p>
  Chef is both the name of a company and the name of a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang. 
  It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration "recipes". Chef is used to streamline 
  the task of configuring and maintaining a company's servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Internap, 
  Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, OpenStack, SoftLayer, 
  Microsoft Azure and Rackspace to automatically provision and configure new machines. Chef contains solutions for both 
  small and large scale systems, with features and pricing for the respective ranges.
